# Reinforcement Learning
This repo showcases my work exploring different algorithms of RL and their applications. 


### Tutorials
1. This tutorial discusses the ICM model as an example of curiosty-driven learning specifically for the mountain car probelm. Read more on my medium post [Curiosity-Driven Learning with OpenAI and Keras](https://medium.com/@gili.karni/solving-the-mountaincar-problem-through-icm-using-openai-and-keras-66f2c7f091fa). Or find the full python code [here](https://github.com/karnigili/ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/ICM.ipynb).

2. This tutorial introduces policy gradient algorithms and provides a keras implementation of a deep REINFORCE model. Read more on my medium post [Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning with Keras](https://medium.com/swlh/policy-gradient-reinforcement-learning-with-keras-57ca6ed32555?source=friends_link&sk=453cf920e6c8fe256a91360d728d7ebd).
