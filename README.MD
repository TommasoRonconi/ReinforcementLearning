This repo showcases my work exploring different algorithms of RL and their applications. 


### Tutorials
1. This tutorial discusses the ICM model as an example of curiosty-driven learning specifically for the mountain car probelm. Read more on medium at my post [Solving the MountainCar Problem through ICM using OpenAI andÂ Keras](https://medium.com/@gili.karni/solving-the-mountaincar-problem-through-icm-using-openai-and-keras-66f2c7f091fa). Or find the full python code [here](https://github.com/karnigili/ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/ICM_model_CarMountain).
